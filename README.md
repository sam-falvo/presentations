# presentations

A repository of all of my presentations.
I should have kept them in a repository earlier.
Now I have to find my past presentations and archive them here as time permits.
But, going forward, all new (public) presentations will be committed here first.

I use a default license of MPLv2, which might not be appropriate for presentations.
Might change license later.
That said, this is only a **default license**.  Consult individual presentation directories for a separate `LICENSE` file first.
